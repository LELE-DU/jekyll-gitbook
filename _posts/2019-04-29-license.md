My research in mathematics is concentrated in the field of 
- Calculus of variations; 
- Nonlinear analysis; 
- Elliptic and parabolic PDEs.

I am interested in the study of nonlocal PDEs, including but not limited to
- Lane-Emden equations;
- Choquard equations;
- Integro-differential elliptic equations;
- Nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations.

I undertake a qualitative analysis of solutions to PDEs such as
- Existences and nonexistences;
- Nondegeneracy;
- Symmetry and uniqueness;
- Regularity;
- Asymptotic behavior.
